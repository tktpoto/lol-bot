## Welcome to lol bot
- This is a python bot that uses the local League Client API to start games and plays them with a simple but effective game loop.
- This bot has leveled up [thousands of league accounts](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/) and is still going strong.
- No pixel botting and/or image recognition makes it easy to run on any setup.
